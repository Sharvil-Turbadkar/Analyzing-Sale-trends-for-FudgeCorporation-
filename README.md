## Recommendations:
1)Fudge Corporation needs to bank more on FudeFlix as it is a promising powerhouse for increasing revenue 

2)Extensive PR Campaigns in midwestern and southeastern states like Texas, Arkansas, Iowa

3)Market Clothing only in areas where it is a luxury like California

4)Provide holiday season offers on the top 10 most selling items as December and January have the highest sales across the year  

5)For FudgeFlix, Increase advertising for premium on west and central region and save costs in servers by temporarily using less powerful/number of servers in the western region 

as it just needs to handle basic plan streaming   

6)Based on product department, focus on improving sales in Housewares and clothes department, while maintaining sales in electronics and hardware.

7)A few customers generate most of the revenue for FudgeMart, so focus on striking deals or contracts with these customers.
